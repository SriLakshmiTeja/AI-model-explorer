# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

Project Overview
Welcome to AI Model Explorer!

This project is a web application aimed at providing a platform for discovering and exploring various AI models. It allows users to browse through available models, view details of specific models, try out models with custom inputs, and upload model information.

Framework and Dependencies
JavaScript Framework: React.js
Routing: React Router DOM
Styling: Material-UI
HTTP Requests: Axios
Page Load Time
The page load time of our application was measured using browser developer tools and third-party performance monitoring tools such as Lighthouse and GTmetrix. On average, the initial page load time was approximately 2.5 seconds.

Performance Optimizations
To optimize the load time and enhance performance, the following strategies were implemented:

Code Splitting: Utilized React's code splitting feature to split the application into smaller chunks, allowing for faster initial loading and improved caching.

Lazy Loading: Implemented lazy loading for components and routes that are not immediately required, reducing the initial bundle size and improving overall load time.

Minification and Compression: Minified JavaScript and CSS files to reduce their size and utilized Gzip compression to further decrease file sizes for faster transmission over the network.

Image Optimization: Optimized images by compressing them without significantly sacrificing quality, resulting in smaller image file sizes and faster loading times.

Server-Side Rendering (SSR): Implemented server-side rendering to generate HTML on the server, enabling faster initial page loads and improved SEO performance.

Caching: Utilized browser caching and server-side caching for static assets and API responses to reduce server load and improve response times for subsequent requests.
